# E2E Testing Standard for Instar Features

> Every feature must prove it's alive in production, not just correct in isolation.

## The Problem This Solves

We have a history of deploying features that work perfectly in unit and integration tests but are **dead on arrival** in production. The root cause is always the same: the feature is never wired into the actual server startup path (`server.ts` -> `AgentServer`).

**Example**: SemanticMemory had 78 passing tests (unit + integration) but was never initialized in `server.ts`. Every `/semantic/*` route returned 503 in production. The integration tests didn't catch this because they manually injected SemanticMemory into AgentServer — bypassing the production wiring entirely.

## The Three-Tier Testing Pyramid

Every significant Instar feature requires all three tiers:

### Tier 1: Unit Tests (`tests/unit/`)
- Test the module in isolation with **real dependencies** (real SQLite, real filesystem)
- No HTTP, no Express, no AgentServer
- Focus: Does the logic work correctly?

### Tier 2: Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`)
- Test the full HTTP pipeline: `HTTP request -> Express route -> Module -> Storage -> Response`
- Manually construct and inject dependencies into AgentServer
- Focus: Do the API routes work when the feature is available?

### Tier 3: E2E Lifecycle Tests (`tests/e2e/`)
- Test the **production initialization path**
- Initialize the feature **the same way `server.ts` does** — same config, same path resolution, same error handling
- Pass it to AgentServer the same way production does
- Focus: **Is the feature actually alive?** Does it return 200, not 503?

## E2E Test Template

Every E2E test must follow this structure:

```typescript
/**
 * E2E test — [FeatureName] full lifecycle.
 *
 * Tests the complete PRODUCTION path:
 *   1. Server starts with [Feature] initialized (same as server.ts does)
 *   2. [Feature] API routes return 200 (not 503 — the "dead on arrival" check)
 *   3. [Core operations work through the full HTTP pipeline]
 *   ...
 *
 * WHY THIS TEST EXISTS:
 * Integration tests mock the wiring — they create [Feature] manually
 * and inject it into AgentServer. That proves the routes work IF the
 * feature is wired up. But it doesn't catch the case where server.ts
 * never creates [Feature], making every route return 503 in production.

        .set(auth());

      // This is THE test that catches "dead on arrival" bugs.
      // If this returns 503, the feature was never initialized in server.ts.
      expect(res.status).toBe(200);
    });
  });

  // Phase 2+: Test the feature's full lifecycle through the API...
});
```

## Phase 1 Is Non-Negotiable

The single most important test in any E2E file is:

```typescript
it('returns 200, not 503 — feature is wired into production', ...)
```

This one assertion catches the entire class of "dead on arrival" bugs. Everything else is gravy. If you write only one E2E test for a feature, make it this one.

## What "Same as server.ts" Means

The E2E test must mirror how `server.ts` initializes the feature:

| Aspect | Integration Test (Tier 2) | E2E Test (Tier 3) |
|--------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Feature initialization | Manual, in test setup | Mirrors `server.ts` code |
| Config resolution | Test-specific paths | Same `path.join(stateDir, ...)` pattern |
| Error handling | May skip | Must include try/catch like production |
| Dependency injection | Direct constructor arg | Same way `new AgentServer({...})` receives it |

If `server.ts` changes its initialization pattern and the E2E test doesn't break, the E2E test is wrong.

## Case Study: The HMAC Bug That Only E2E Caught (2026-02-28)

The inter-agent messaging system uses HMAC-SHA256 to protect offline message drops from tampering. When an agent drops a message to disk for an offline agent, it signs the envelope. When the offline agent starts up and picks up the message, it verifies the HMAC.

**What the unit tests said**: All passing. `computeDropHmac` + `verifyDropHmac` paired tests worked perfectly. Generate HMAC, verify it — match. Tamper with the HMAC string — rejection. Different agent — rejection. All green.

**What was actually happening**: `computeDropHmac` used `JSON.stringify(fields, Object.keys(fields).sort())` as a "canonical" serializer. The replacer array was `["message", "nonce", "originServer", "timestamp"]`. But `JSON.stringify` array replacers filter properties at **every nesting level** — not just the top. Since the `message` object's properties (`id`, `from`, `to`, `body`, `subject`, etc.) weren't in that array, they were all stripped. The `message` property serialized as `{}` regardless of content.

**Why unit tests couldn't catch this**: Unit tests compute and verify in pairs — both sides use the same broken serializer. A consistently broken hash is still consistent. The HMAC matched every time because both computation and verification stripped the message content identically. The unit tests proved the system was *self-consistent*, not that it was *correct*.

**Why the E2E test caught it**: The E2E multi-agent test (`messaging-multi-agent.test.ts`) sent a real message from Agent A's server to an offline agent via the drop directory, then tampered with `envelope.message.body` in the JSON file on disk, then ran `pickupDroppedMessages()` with a separate store. The tampered body should have invalidated the HMAC — but it didn't, because the HMAC never covered the body in the first place. The test expected `result.rejected === 1` but got `result.rejected === 0`.

**The fix**: Replaced the broken `JSON.stringify` replacer with a proper recursive `canonicalJSON` function that sorts keys at every nesting level.

**The lesson**: Unit tests prove *consistency*. E2E tests prove *correctness*. A security-critical function with 100% unit test coverage had a total bypass bug that only surfaced when two real components interacted through the filesystem with real data mutations in between. This is why E2E tests are non-optional.

## When to Write E2E Tests

Required for any feature that:
- Adds new API routes
- Requires initialization in `server.ts`
- Has a dependency that could fail to load (optional deps, native modules)
- Involves data persistence (databases, file I/O)

Not required for:
- Pure utility functions
- CLI-only commands that don't touch the server
- Documentation or config changes

## Reference Implementations

- `tests/e2e/semantic-memory-lifecycle.test.ts` — 25 tests, 11 phases. The gold standard.
- `tests/e2e/episodic-memory-lifecycle.test.ts` — 16 tests, 5 phases. Mirrors server.ts sentinel wiring with Telegram dual-source testing. Demonstrates mock branching on prompt preamble (not keywords).
- `tests/e2e/topic-memory-lifecycle.test.ts` — Topic memory lifecycle.
- `tests/e2e/lifecycle.test.ts` — Core server lifecycle.

## Running E2E Tests

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npx vitest run tests/e2e/

# Run a specific E2E test
npx vitest run tests/e2e/semantic-memory-lifecycle.test.ts

# Run all tests (unit + integration + e2e)
npx vitest run
```

## Checklist for New Features

Before a feature is considered complete:

- [ ] Unit tests pass (Tier 1)

- [ ] Phase 1 "feature is alive" test explicitly checks for 200 vs 503
- [ ] Feature initialization in E2E mirrors `server.ts` exactly
- [ ] Feature is actually wired into `server.ts` and `new AgentServer({...})`
